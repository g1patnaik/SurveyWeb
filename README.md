## Project Vision

SurveyWeb aims to provide a flexible, open-source platform for collecting, mapping, and interpreting issue data (like problems or opportunities) at granular levels (village, town, district, etc.), from multiple sources (field surveys, social web, etc.).

See [`VISION.md`](VISION.md) for details and ideas for implementation.
