# SurveyWeb

**A community-driven research platform that empowers policymakers and NGOs with granular, data-informed insights.**

## Project Vision
SurveyWeb is an open-source initiative designed to help local governments, NGOs, and research institutions collect, visualize, and interpret data on socio-economic and infrastructure issues—down to the village, town, or district level—from multiple sources (field surveys, social media, community feedback, remote sensing). It aims to transform raw input into actionable reports that inform policy-making, manifesto formation, and development planning.

## Use Cases
- **Assess infrastructure gaps** (e.g., sanitation, roads)
- **Capture citizen feedback** on public services
- **Monitor intervention outcomes** over time

## Key Features (Envisioned)
- Multi-source data ingestion
- Geospatial mapping and dashboards
- Report generation tailored to NGOs and policymakers
- Secure, privacy-conscious collaboration tools
- Export options (CSV, PDF)

## Target Users
- Local governments & policy planners
- NGOs and development agencies
- Research organizations & advocacy groups

## Roadmap
1. Concept & Use Case Gathering  
2. Prototype Development  
3. Pilot Deployment with Stakeholders  
4. Iterative Refinement
